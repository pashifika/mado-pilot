## Branch strategy

`main` contains released, production-ready code. Development for each release
is collected in a version branch named `dev/x.y.z`, where `x.y.z` is a semantic
version without a leading `v` (for example, `dev/0.2.0`).

Use short-lived topic branches for individual changes:

- `feat/<name>` for features
- `fix/<name>` for bug fixes
- `docs/<name>` for documentation
- `refactor/<name>` for refactoring
- `test/<name>` for tests
- `chore/<name>` for maintenance
- `ci/<name>` for CI changes
- `build/<name>` for build changes
- `perf/<name>` for performance changes

Branch names after the prefix must contain lowercase letters, numbers, `.`,
`_`, or `-`.

## Pull request flow

1. Create `dev/x.y.z` from `main` for the next release.
2. Create each topic branch from that `dev/x.y.z` branch.
3. Open a pull request from the topic branch into the same `dev/x.y.z` branch.
4. When the release is ready, open a pull request from `dev/x.y.z` into `main`.
5. After merging into `main`, tag the release as `vx.y.z`.

Emergency fixes follow the same flow: create the next patch-version
`dev/x.y.z` branch from `main`, then merge a `fix/<name>` branch into it.

Pull requests directly from topic branches into `main`, or from one version
development branch into another, are rejected by the branch policy check.

## Protected branches

The repository rulesets protect `main` and all `dev/*` branches:

- Changes must be submitted through a pull request.
- The branch policy check must pass.
- Review conversations must be resolved.
- Only squash merging is allowed.
- Force pushes are blocked.
- Linear history is required.

Deletion is blocked for `main`. Merged topic and `dev/*` branches are deleted
automatically; deletion remains allowed for `dev/*` so completed release
branches do not accumulate.

The required approval count is currently zero because a pull request author
cannot approve their own pull request. Increase it to one or more when another
maintainer is available to review changes.
